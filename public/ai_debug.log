  "topic": "Some people think that technology is making people less social. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
  "questionAnalysis": "This is a 'To what extent do you agree or disagree' Task 2 prompt. Key instruction keywords: 'To what extent', 'agree or disagree'. The task requires the writer to take a clear position on whether technology reduces social interaction, address both sides of the argument (if relevant), and support their claims with reasons and examples. Constraints include maintaining a consistent position throughout and ensuring all ideas are extended logically.",

      "label": "Task Response",
      "reason": "The essay addresses the core question and presents a clear, consistent position that technology enhances social connectivity when used wisely. It acknowledges a counterargument about excessive device use, fulfilling the 'to what extent' requirement. However, main ideas are underdeveloped—there is no specific evidence, examples, or detailed explanations to support claims (e.g., no mention of specific platforms or real-world scenarios), which limits the depth of the response.",

      "reason": "The overall progression of ideas is logical, moving from an introductory position to supporting points, a counterargument, and a conclusion. However, the entire essay is presented as a single block, with no clear paragraphing to separate distinct ideas. Cohesive devices are basic and somewhat mechanical (e.g., 'Firstly', 'Secondly', 'However'), and there is limited use of referencing or substitution to avoid repetition.",

    "rewrite": "In the digital age, technological advancements have transformed every aspect of daily life, including how humans connect with one another. While critics argue that smartphones, social media, and other digital tools have eroded in-person social skills and isolated individuals, I firmly believe that technology, when used responsibly, significantly enhances global social connectivity and strengthens interpersonal bonds."

    "focus": "Task 2: Topic Sentence & Logical Extension",
    "critique": "The original supporting point is underdeveloped with no examples or explanation. This limits Task Response as it fails to demonstrate why social media improves connectivity.",
    "rewrite": "One key benefit of technology is its ability to bridge geographical gaps that once separated people. For instance, social media platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram allow users to maintain regular contact with friends and family members living overseas, sharing real-time updates about their lives through photos, videos, and instant messages. Before the advent of such tools, staying connected with distant loved ones required costly long-distance calls or slow, infrequent letters, making sustained relationships challenging. Technology has thus made global social interaction accessible and affordable for people of all backgrounds."

    "rewrite": "In conclusion, while excessive, unregulated use of digital devices can reduce opportunities for face-to-face interaction, the overall impact of technology on social connectivity is overwhelmingly positive. By enabling cross-border communication, facilitating real-time virtual interactions, and creating communities for like-minded individuals, technology has expanded rather than restricted social horizons. Ultimately, technology is a neutral tool; its effect on social behavior depends on how humans choose to use it."

    "correction": "Secondly, real-time video calls via applications like Zoom or Skype offer a far more intimate mode of interaction than traditional handwritten letters, as they allow participants to interpret facial expressions and body language—critical cues for conveying emotional nuance.",
    "explanation": "Task Response: Elaborates on why video calls are more personal, linking non-verbal cues to emotional communication. Grammatical Range & Accuracy: Uses a non-restrictive clause to add detail, demonstrating control over complex sentence structures."

    "original": "However, excessive use of devices can lead to less face-to-face interaction.",
    "correction": "That said, excessive and unregulated use of digital devices can indeed diminish opportunities for in-person socialization; for example, teenagers who spend several hours daily scrolling through TikTok may prioritize virtual interactions over engaging with peers at school or family members during meals.",
    "explanation": "Coherence & Cohesion: Uses a more sophisticated cohesive device ('That said') instead of the basic 'however' to signal a counterargument. Task Response: Adds a specific, relatable example to support the counterpoint, making it more credible."
