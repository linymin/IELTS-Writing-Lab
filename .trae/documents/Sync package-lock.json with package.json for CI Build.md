Based on the build log, the error is `npm error code EUSAGE` with the message `npm ci can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json ... are in sync`. This is happening because we manually edited `package.json` to fix the dependency versions (downgrading `ai` and `@ai-sdk/*`), but we did not update `package-lock.json` to reflect these changes. The build server runs `npm ci`, which strictly checks for this synchronization and fails if they don't match.

### Solution Plan

1.  **Delete `package-lock.json`**: Since the lockfile contains the old, incorrect versions (like the phantom `ai@6.0.57`), the cleanest way to fix this is to delete it.
2.  **Delete `node_modules`**: Remove the existing installed packages to ensure a fresh install.
3.  **Run `npm install`**: This will generate a *new* `package-lock.json` that is perfectly in sync with the corrected `package.json`.
4.  **Verification**: The user will need to commit the new `package-lock.json` to their repository so the build server can use it.

I will perform the local cleanup and install to generate the correct lockfile.

**Note**: I cannot directly "push" to the user's git repo, but I can perform the file operations in the IDE. The user will then need to commit the changes.

### Tasks
1.  Remove `package-lock.json` and `node_modules`.
2.  Run `npm install` to regenerate the lockfile.
