I will implement a global background evaluation system to improve the user experience as requested.

### 1. Global State Management (The "Background" Engine)
I will create a new `EvaluationContext` (`src/lib/context/evaluation-context.tsx`) to manage the evaluation process at the application root level.
- **Why**: This ensures the evaluation continues running even if you navigate between pages (Workshop → Home → Questions).
- **Features**:
  - Manages the AI streaming connection (`useObject`).
  - Runs the 300-second timer and determines the current "logical stage" (e.g., "Deeply analyzing structure...").
  - Handles the "Evaluation Complete" state and audio notification.

### 2. New UI Components
- **Evaluation Page (`/evaluating`)**:
  - A dedicated immersive page showing the 300s countdown.
  - Displays dynamic status messages (0-30s, 30-120s, etc.) as requested.
  - Includes a "Minimize" button to let users browse other pages while waiting.
- **Global Progress Bar**:
  - A subtle progress bar at the top of the screen.
  - **Visibility**: Only appears when evaluation is running in the background (i.e., user is NOT on the `/evaluating` page).
  - **Interactivity**: Clicking it returns the user to the `/evaluating` page.
  - **Completion**: turns green and shows a "View Report" button when finished.

### 3. Integration & Refactoring
- **Workshop Page**: Replace the current local submission logic with the new global `startEvaluation` function.
- **Rewrite Page**: Update to use the same global system, ensuring consistent behavior.
- **App Layout**: Wrap the entire application in the `EvaluationProvider` and inject the `GlobalProgressBar`.

### 4. Logic Flow
1. **Start**: User clicks "Submit" -> Redirects to `/evaluating` -> Timer & AI Stream start.
2. **Wait/Multitask**: User can stay and watch OR click "Background Run" (or navigate away).
3. **Background**: Top progress bar appears. Timer continues.
4. **Finish**: 
   - If on `/evaluating`: "View Report" button appears.
   - If in background: Top bar turns green, plays sound, shows "View Report".
5. **Result**: Clicking "View Report" fetches the final ID and navigates to the report.
