# Refactor Improvement Page Logic for Version Management

I will refactor `src/app/improvement/page.tsx` to group exercises by topic and implement version control UI.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Structure Update
- Define a new interface `EssayGroup` to hold the latest version and history list for each topic.
- Update `fetchEssaysToImprove` to:
  1. Fetch all evaluations (existing logic).
  2. Group evaluations by `topic` (question text).
  3. Sort each group by date (descending).
  4. Separate the `latest` version from `history`.
  5. Filter groups based on the `latest` version's score against the `targetScore`.

### 2. UI Component Refactoring
- **Parent Card Redesign**:
  - Display only the `latest` version.
  - Make the main card area clickable, linking to the **Evaluation Report** (`/evaluation/[id]`).
  - Add a **"Start Rewrite"** button (prominent action), linking to the **Rewrite Page** (`/evaluation/[id]/rewrite`).
  - Add a **"View History"** toggle button (if history exists).
  - Implement a "stacked card" visual effect using CSS/Tailwind shadows when history exists.

- **History List Implementation**:
  - Create a collapsible section below the parent card.
  - Render a list of historical versions when expanded.
  - Each history item will display the date and overall band score.
  - Clicking a history item links to its specific **Evaluation Report**.

### 3. State Management
- Add state to track expanded/collapsed status for each topic group (e.g., `expandedGroups: Record<string, boolean>`).

## Technical Details
- **File**: `src/app/improvement/page.tsx`
- **Grouping Key**: `question_text` (Topic).
- **Navigation**:
  - Card Body -> `/evaluation/[id]`
  - Start Rewrite -> `/evaluation/[id]/rewrite`
  - History Item -> `/evaluation/[id]`
- **Icons**: Use `ChevronDown`/`ChevronUp` for the history toggle, `History` icon for the indicator.

This approach resolves the issue of duplicate tiled cards and adds the requested version management features.
