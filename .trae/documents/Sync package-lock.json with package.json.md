The error occurs because `package-lock.json` is out of sync with `package.json` (e.g., `package.json` requires `@ai-sdk/openai@^3.0.21` but the lockfile has `1.3.24`). `npm ci` is strict and fails in this scenario.

I will run `npm install` locally to:
1.  Resolve all dependencies based on `package.json`.
2.  Update `package-lock.json` with the correct versions.

This will generate a valid lockfile that passes `npm ci` in your build environment.
